In this JAVA project, two CSV files are being loaded into memory.
1- Person.CSV file
2- Relationships.csv file

First file loads all Person related data in memory.
Second file loads relationship for all person in memory.

People are linked through either family and extended relationship structure or through friendship relationship.
Classes and methods are being provided to get all family and extended family members for a particular person in that particular family tree.

JUnit tests are being written to test different logics such as:
1- methods are loading CSV files correctly into memory.
2- Correct family and extended members are being loaded.
3- Correct friendship relationship are being loaded.

This project uses Gradle for building and running the tests
